# Fix Requirements


## Plain Text Downloads

* Search Functionality with program(JSON API!)
  * Where to search (DOM/LNDB/Periodika?)
* Text conversion from ALTO/EPUB -> TXT (PDF->TXT is to be avoided at all costs!)
* How to host TXT files in periodika/dom (along with epub,rdf,pdf download)

## Analysis Tools
* Swiss Impresso example
* https://impresso-project.ch/
* https://impresso-project.ch/app/
Notes: using d3.js - inline svg, vue for front end

* https://books.google.com/ngrams - Google must have a very good index for these due to speed


## Typical Challenges

* Working with external tools , provide on demand corpus

* Working with Ailab tools (possibly LNB hosting) internal tools
Ailab for reserachers specialized

* Built in functionality in our tools
